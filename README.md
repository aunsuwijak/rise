Since the question said that I can use any programming language, so I choose ruby. All the files related live in `src` folder.

### Requirements

- You need ruby 2.7.2 with bundler in order to run the program.
- Make sure you are using the right ruby version on your path then run `bundle install` to install dependencies.

- Take a look at coverage at `./coverage/index.html`
